# ModularNN
Some Matlab codes for my studies on modular neural networks. All code here was tested on Matlab 2003
Keywords: Neural Network, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Choquet Integral, Backpropagation

# Choquet
Simple functions for an choquet aggregator. Code by Andre Pacheco

# datas
All raw databases are here

# dbn
Deep Belief Network using RBM. For now all code, except for dbnCost.m and runDBN.m, is from Tanaka`s code. Any questions about that code tt is strongly adviced to ask directly him:

# DE
Diferential Evolution. I use this to optimize some parameters. code by Andre Pacheco

# ensemble
neural networks ensemble with a NN aggregator. DO NOT USE IS IT YET BROKEN

#ensembleChoquet
neural networks ensemble with a Choquet aggregator. DO NOT USE IS IT YET BROKEN

#errorMetrics
Some helper functions to measure error metrics

#graph
Some helper functions to plot graphs

# modular
modular neural networks. DO NOT USE IT IS YET TOO HARDCODED

# nelder
Nelder-means. I use this to optimize some parameters. Code by Felipe Lucci

# nn
Simple feedfoward neural networks with backpropagation. It is actually using matalab`s native code.

# pso
Particle Swarm Optimization. I use this to optimize some parameters.

#Testes1
just some testing functions. It is mostly garbage

#Utils
various helper functions
